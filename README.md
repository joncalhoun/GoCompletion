# GoCompletion

A Sublime Text 3 plugin providing Go (golang) autocompletion.

## Warning - This probably won't work for you.

This is likely not working and will be changed a lot if I continue to develop it. As of now this was just an experiment in seeing how to build a Sublime Text 3 plugin and interacting with the `gocode` package to get completion information.
